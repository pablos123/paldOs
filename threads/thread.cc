/// * `Fork` -- create a thread to run a procedure concurrently with the
///   caller (this is done in two steps -- first allocate the Thread object,
///   then call `Fork` on it).
/// * `Finish` -- called when the forked procedure finishes, to clean up.
/// * `Yield` -- relinquish control over the CPU to another ready thread.
/// * `Sleep` -- relinquish control over the CPU, but thread is now blocked.
///   In other words, it will not run again, until explicitly put back on the
///   ready queue.
